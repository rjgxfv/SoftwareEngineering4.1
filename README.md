    From 2013-2016, there was a scandal going around with Cambridge Analytica where they were exploiting raw data of 87 million Facebook profiles. One of the ethical quandaries that came up was that Cambridge was leveraging data mining techniques that were exploited from fakebook’s lax privacy features. By this data mining, America’s safety was violated, and people started to realize how their data could be exploited on the internet. Along with them mining people's data, they were also creating fake social media accounts to influence votes. In my opinion, this wasn't too bad because anyone could create a Facebook account, it is up to the voter's discretion if they want to believe the profile. But some people in the US did feel like their safety was being violated because of the mental manipulation they were trying to do. 
    Another thing that came up was that Russia was being contacted about the election, and this was when the US had it’s safety violated because foreign countries were trying to influence the election. This was a big deal because if Russia was impacting the election, there could be suspicions that the election was rigged.
